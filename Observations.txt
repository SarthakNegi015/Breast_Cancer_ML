o	Problem Statement:
	1.	The target variable has 2 types of cancer.
	2.	Identifying whether has ‘Malignant’ (type 0) or ‘Benign’ (type1) disease.
	3.	Analysing the most occurring disease type (0 or 1).


o	Observation:
	1.	There is no missing or null values in the dataset.
	2.	Only 3 features out of 30 are showing the highly negative correlation for target variable.
	3.	Target (1) i.e. ‘Benign’ disease has the highest occurrence compared to Target (0) i.e. ‘Malignant’.
	4.	Post Model training:
		a.	Precision Score=0.9466
		b.	Recall Score=1.0
		c.	f_beta Score (beta=2.0)= 0.9888
		d.	Accuracy Score=0.9649


o	Conclusion:
		The model is performing well in the test data


.
	Features:
	- Logistic Regression Based Project
	- Exploratory Data Analysis with observations for better understanding.
